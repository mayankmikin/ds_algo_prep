# A simple solution is to find all prime factors of both numbers, then find intersection of all factors present 
# in both numbers. Finally return product of elements in the intersection.

# An efficient solution is to use Euclidean algorithm which is the main algorithm used for this purpose. 
# The idea is, GCD of two numbers doesnâ€™t change if smaller number is subtracted from a bigger number.

# sets me intersection hota h par list me nhi hota
# Python program to illustrate the intersection 
# of two lists 
# By the use of this hybrid method the complexity of the program falls to O(n).

#     # Use of hybrid method 
#     temp = set(lst2) 
#     lst3 = [value for value in lst1 if value in temp] 
#     return lst3 
# bcoz the above method returns [2, 7, 7] which is wrong as [2, 7, 7] [2, 2, 2, 7.0]  should retune [2,7]
